Feedmailer - A Feed-Aggregator (RSS/Atom to email gateway)
Topics: atom rss feedreader feed-aggregator feed-aggregator-daemon feedmailer

Feed aggregator that queries RSS/Atom feeds and delivers new articles by
email.  Using the Sendmail-Commandline-Interface and optional a Cronjob.

No need for a feedreader; use your email client!

But a 2nd main-feature is the option to run hooks.  With Feedmailer you
can execute any command as a hook for an article.

if a modul is not packaged in Debian see below.
